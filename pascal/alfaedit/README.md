# AlfaEdit

Program to run and trace deterministic finite automata.  I have three versions of this laying around, and this is 
long before I knew what source code control was, so it's in three different files.  I'm going to collapse those into 
commits.

I know it was started in TIP '88, but the last version is massively revised, so I probably did it at home after.

Massive creeping featureitis.
